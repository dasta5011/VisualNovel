Script Idea #5 --

Type of Game: Detective Mystery,  

Theme:  

Setting:    

Protagonist:  Police Detective-Homicide
Few different arcs it could follow:
-Killer has a way of killing people that seems to be almost supernatural/godlike.  How do you catch a murderer who can do things beyond human capability?  How do you convict a killer of the impossible?  Think Death Note perhaps?
-Good job! You just became a new detective and you're young, freshly trained, and fired up to go, but there's one problem, your partner is a young girl!  Surprisingly enough, she is a great detective and her help proves more than necessary when one of your first cases proves to be a series of gruesome murders with few clues.  Change Game type to humorous?
