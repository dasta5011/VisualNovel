Script Idea #3 --

Type of Game:  

Theme:  Morality Questioned, Supernatural

Setting:  Current/Modern

Protagonist:  Character who after an unfortunate incident, is well on his/her way to dying in a pool of his/her own blood.  A person unknown to him/her crouches over him/her in his/her final moments and makes a proposal:  Eternal Life in exchange for the protagonist to...
Few different arcs it could follow:
-Protagonist has to fill the role of a Reaper, taking lives, and through it is forced to question whether or not his/her own life is worth this.
-Protagonist is saved, and the process infuses him/her with something to see the demons and monsters of the world, whether they be intangible to normal humans, or imitating the human form perfectly.  He is tasked with fighting against them, stopping them, to eliminate them and the poison and death they bring with them.  He/she must face the look of death every day when he/she fails to save the lives caught in the crossfire or in the monsters path.
-Character is saved without any unique request that he/she can remember, and their saviour simply is gone.  However, there is now a strange mark/tattoo on characters back/spine/neck.  It doesn't take too long for things to get weird when the character starts having blackouts, ending in places they dont remember going, and worse, coming to in the middle of the night with blood soaked hands.  Is it some other force controlling the character? Or is it simply their inner self finally acting out how it wanted?

Mechanics:
-Depinding on the story, I'm not sure if mechanics are 100% needed in this story.  There could be some basic romance choices, otherwise I think most mechanics, if any, should be implemented on the mission based level.  I.E.  Character is hunting monsters?  Make doing certain things over others increase chances of success/not dying, or offer different routes to the goal, i.e. capture vs elimination.  If doing the Reaper story, different choices effect how the soul is taken.  Does the player talk the person into a peaceful death?  Do they die by fate hitting them with a car when they try to escape the player, and filled with fear and regrets?  Does the player take their soul by force?
