Script Idea #6 --

Type of Game:  Stats, Strategy

Theme:  

Setting:  Could be similar to ancient rome, or even futuristic scifi setting, or modern day.

Protagonist:  Gladiator combatant
Few different arcs it could follow:
-Character is fighting for their freedom.


Mechanics:  
-Character picks their weapons/armor before Gladiator battles.  This affects their stats.  Maybe let character pick from different type of attacks during combat too, which effects their stance, damage done, and how vulnerable they are to attack.
