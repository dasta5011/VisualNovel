Script Idea #4 --

Type of Game:  Stats, Levelling, 

Theme:  MMO, RPG, 

Setting:  ?? Depends on MMO...probably classic fantasy/rpg.  Maybe with a dash of steampunk/add guns.

Protagonist:  One of the players brought into the game.
Few different arcs it could follow:
-Death is permanent for any player. As far as anyone can tell, dying means you're gone forever.  Or maybe you are let free from the game?  No one knows.
-Death simply works how it did in the game with respawning.  
-Death simply respawns you, except you lose all memories since you arrived in the new world.  Meaning new friends forget each other, you forget the struggles you've been through, and even what you've done to get where you are.  Could have a "memento" feel, as the characters belongings stay the same, and they may even use a journal to keep with them.  This way, having a party member fall in battle is basically the same as losing them.

Mechanics:
