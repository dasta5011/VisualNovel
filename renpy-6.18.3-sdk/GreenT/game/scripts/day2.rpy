    ##Day 1 Recap - Birthday
    ##Same Day/Day After Hiroshi revealed his identity to the other families
    ##Take care of Hiroshi -- Meet up with Mayu
    ##Mayu Finds out one way or another -- Terms can vary
    ##Grandfather wants him to stay home from college today
    ##Could switch focus to Mayu for a bit.
    ##Maybe have Koji brought to secluded area where he can talk with his grandfather and other family thugs about what he can do or his future roll.  Maybe have Yukino with since she has been involved in this herself.
    ##Could be his first mission to show his competence. Something based on his families specialty? Or something basic.
    ##Right now his families specialty is blackmail and gambling. The kind of people who will put you in an unsuspecting trap then wring you dry with you powerless to fight back.
    ##kind of want the days to detail Koji's descendance into the darker underworld of his families lifestyle and see him transform from a college student into someone who has been forced to sacrifice friends and himself to become whats needed to make his family secure
    ##might add in a scene of Mayu talking with her mother
