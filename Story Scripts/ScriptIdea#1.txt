Script Idea #1 --

Type of Game:  Mystery, action, some romance

Theme:  Underground crime, Contested Territory/Warring Factions, Avoid getting caught by police/detectives

Setting:  2020's, inner city, cyberpunk, throwback to 1950's detective work

Protagonist:  Son/Daughter/grandon/grandaughter ? of someone central to the mafia family line of power. 
Few different arcs it could follow:
-Doesn't want to be part of the family, but gets dragged in regardless.  Maybe he/she just wants to start a peaceful game company and make games all day.
-Could want vengeance for a sibling that was murdered by rivals, could be driven by revenge and/or protect a younger sibling.
-Could blame self for a relatives death, gets involved more to feel like he/she is taking responsibility/self punishment.


Mechanics:  
-Depending on choices related to dealing with family business and territorial affairs, reputation points are earned with the different factions.  Depending on your current faction points with certain factions, alter what happens at key story points.  I.e. "You need 3 Bloodz faction points by the end of Day 7 or you will die" or "Not having 4 Cripz faction points by the beginning of Day 12 makes negotiating peace not an option" or "Having more than 5 Illuminati points on Day 8 will make peace talks with the Bloodz not an option" type of stuff, obviously this isn't told to the player, but sets up story paths.
-Bounty.  Bounty points increase by a different amount depending on the polices findings of the characters involvement in different crimes. I.e. depending on the characters actions, they may get caught at the scene of a crime, leave fingerprints on a murder weapon, or only be leaving footprints behind (or maybe the character wasn't involved at all!  But don't forget evil people framing them..).  If this value ever gets too high, it could lead to the police going after the player directly.
