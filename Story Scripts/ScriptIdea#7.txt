Script Idea #7 --

Type of Game:  Solemn, misleading, plot-twists

Theme:  Dark, confusion, delusions

Setting:  modern day, big city

Protagonist:  Average office worker whose had enough and discovers a new substance that adds meaning to his life in a way he never believed
Few different arcs it could follow:
-When he evaluates his life and work is too much, the character is down in the dumps.  Through some vines, he finds a new substance that's suppose to help him relax.  Saying, "Why not?", he starts using this new designer drug.  Shortly later, he finds out it wasn't a normal drug, it turns out he was chosen to help save the world.  From the monsters and demons roaming the earth.  This so called "drug" he has been taking, has been granting him not only the ability to see these monsters, but also the ability to use magic and enhance his physical limits.
	-After a while, it becomes apparent that the protagonist is delusional, he has been killing people, not monsters this entire time.  His "magic" was just either cheap tricks he believed himself to be magic or adrenalin fuelled human feats.
-The player watches the character descend into a drug fuelled rut, watches as he loses everything. At a turning point, if proper choices were made, the character turns back from his suicide and vows to improve his life.  Things seem to be going well, he is making relationships again, staying clean, and integrating back into society.  Then, it all falls apart when one of many things happen (i.e. his new gf is caught cheating, etc), and the player watches as the character loses his mind once again.  The character gets really hopped up on this fancy new drug that originally brought his downfall, exacts his revenge on whoever wronged him, and with his mind fried, takes off into the night truly believing himself to be a wizard or champion of the shadows and cleansing the demons of the earth (after all, who else but a demon could be evil enough to cause him such pain after all that hard work), and the only satisfaction for the player is that they at least know when the character died, he was happy that he believed he was truly helping people.  So in a way, he died happy, unlike how the majority of his life treated him.  
	-A very mundane and average story, but still gives lots of room for character development. My only worry is there might not be a strong enough hook.
-Yes, he tried drugs to escape the self loathing and hate of his work, his life, but when it let him see his long dead younger sister, he refused to even try giving the drug up.  He's never been able to catch up to her, just chase after her.  This story would detail the pain and anguish of a bitter man, and his one hope of seeing the one person who ever treated him kindly again, even across the veil of the afterlife.  
	-I think this one has potential, and even a few more route ideas based off it.  He could meet a mysterious character who offers to bring back his sister if he kills X number of certain types of people.  Or, he could wake up from his drug trips and have something new in his hand from his sister, but in truth, he killed someone and took it from them while he was blacked out, and slowly reveal the dark nature.  Even more room to expand.


Mechanics:  
-Addiction/Composure meter.  If the character has taken too much of the drug, or has taken it too recently, it'll be harder for him to control himself in situations and may cause certain normal actions to be unavailable and force the character to lash out or act sporadic when dealing with others, like his boss or the police or women.
-The Sister Puzzle.  If using the dead sister route, give the player options where to look for her next, and different places provide different parts/clues that he comes back with. Collecting certain combinations unlock new areas and different endings depending on where the character goes.
