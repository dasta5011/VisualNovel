Script Idea #4 --

Type of Game:  Stats, Levelling, 

Theme:  MMO, RPG, 

Setting:  ?? Depends on MMO...probably classic fantasy/rpg.  Maybe with a dash of steampunk/add guns.

Protagonist:  One of the players brought into the game.
Few different arcs it could follow:
-Death is permanent for any player. As far as anyone can tell, dying means you're gone forever.  Or maybe you are let free from the game?  No one knows.
-Death simply works how it did in the game with respawning.
