For now, to run the game run the Renpy.exe, select GreenT on the left hand side, and hit Launch application.
This is the game in its current state.
From the launcher, you can also open the game/asset directory and open the script for the game.

For tutorials, run the Tutorial program below GreenT, hit start, and a few clicks and you'll be at the menu.  
There is also HTML help files in the root of the Renpy folder inside the Doc folder.
